# Network Project

## Introduction
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on the basics of networking, including understanding network protocols, configuring network interfaces, and troubleshooting network issues.

## Objectives
- Understand the OSI model and its layers
- Learn about different network protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, etc.)
- Configure network interfaces on various operating systems

- Troubleshoot common network issues

## Requirements
- A computer with internet access
- Basic knowledge of command-line interface (CLI)
- Familiarity with operating systems (Linux, Windows, or macOS)
